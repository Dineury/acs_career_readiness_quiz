 Hi Indigo 

I recently started at BloomTech, I’m finishing up unit 1 right now! I’ve been trying to connect with alumni to learn a bit more about their path into the tech industry and came across your profile while doing a little research. I’m intrigued by your career path. Junior Developer to Senior Full stack web dev. 

Right now I’m just looking for advice on what I can do to set myself apart in the market when I start job searching. Would you be willing to connect and share your experience and advices with me.

I look forward to speaking with you soon!
